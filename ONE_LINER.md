# One Liners for Cloud Computing - Quick Revision
1. OS assisted virtualization (**paravirtualization**): In this technique, the guest OS is modified to be virtualization-aware (allow it to communicate through hypercalls with the hypervisor, so as to handle privileged and sensitive instructions).

2. What is most commonly used for managing the resources for every virtual system - **Hyperviser**

3. Creating more logical IT resources, within one physical system is called -  **Virtualization**

4. Three main benefits of virtualization - **(a) Flexible and efficient allocation of resources (b)	Lowers the cost of IT infrastructure (c) Remote access and rapid scalability**

5. It helps a user to have remote access to an application from a server. -**Application Virtualization.**

6. The correct type of full virtualization is ____. - **Software assisted and Hardware-assisted both**

7. Identify virtualizations: Due to binary translation, it often criticized for performance issues. - 	**Software assisted full virtualizations**

8. Identify virtualizations: Guest OS’s instructions might allow a virtual context to execute privileged instructions directly on the processor, even though it is virtualized. -  **Hardware-assisted full virtualizations**

9. ________refers to the use of a remote computer from a local computer where the actual computer user is located. - **Virtual Computing**

10. ________is an operating system or application environment that is installed on software, which reproduces dedicated hardware virtually. - **Virtual Machine**

11. In computing, ________ improves the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units, or disk drives. - **Load Balancer**

15. ___ enables the key benefit of cloud computing: shared, ubiquitous access - Abstraction.

16. Virtualization assigns a ____ for a physical resource and then provides a pointer to that physical resource when a request is made. - Logical Name

17. Load balancing virtualizes systems and resources by mapping a logical address to a ______ - **physical address**.

18. ____ provide system resource access to virtual machines - VMM (Virtual Machine Manager).

19. An operating system running on a Type ______ VM is full virtualization. - **1**

20. In _______ the virtual machine simulates hardware, so it can be independent of the underlying system hardware. - **Emulation**

23. ____ is what controls and allocates what portion of hardware resources each operating system should get, in order every one o them to get what they need and not to disrupt each other. - **Hyperviser**

24. _____ provides on-demand access to fundamental computing resources–physical and virtual servers, networking, and storage—over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. - **IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)**

25. All cloud computing applications suffer from the inherent _______ that is intrinsic in their WAN connectivity. - **Latency**

29. A ______ can provision computer resources without the need for interaction with cloud service provider personnel - **Client**

30. CaaS stands for _____________ as service. - **Communication**

31. There are ____ types of service model are mainly present in Cloud. - **Three**

32. The three different service models is together known as the _____ model of cloud computing. - **SPI (software, platform, infrastructure)**

33. _______ provides virtual machines, virtual storage, virtual infrastructure, and other hardware assets - **IaaS**

34. ______ enables batch processing, which greatly speeds up high-processing applications. - **Scalability**
