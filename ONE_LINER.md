# One Liners for Cloud Computing - Quick Revision
1. OS assisted virtualization (paravirtualization): In this technique, the guest OS is modified to be virtualization-aware (allow it to communicate through hypercalls with the hypervisor, so as to handle privileged and sensitive instructions).

2. What is most commonly used for managing the resources for every virtual system - Hyperviser

3. 	Creating more logical IT resources, within one physical system is called ________. - Virtualization.

4. Three main benefits of virtualization - (a) Flexible and efficient allocation of resources (b)	Lowers the cost of IT infrastructure (c) Remote access and rapid scalability

5. It helps a user to have remote access to an application from a server. - Application Virtualization.

6. The correct type of full virtualization is ____. - Software assisted and Hardware-assisted both

7. Identify virtualizations: Due to binary translation, it often criticized for performance issues. - 	Software assisted full virtualizations

8. Identify virtualizations: Guest OSâ€™s instructions might allow a virtual context to execute privileged instructions directly on the processor, even though it is virtualized. -  **Hardware-assisted full virtualizations**
